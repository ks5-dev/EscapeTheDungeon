## Save The Prince (unfinished)

This is a game I made with Raylib to learn more about this awesome 2D framework.

Work is still in progress, so don't expect anything yet.

Premise of the game: In the Kingdom of fantasy, the princess found herself entrapped in a dungeon upon being captured by some mystical creatures.
There is no prince to help her out, in fact, after a brave attempt to rescue her, he is captured too. As the guard is asleep, you try to get out and rescue both you and the prince. Can you pull this off? 

Some of the arts are taken from opengameart.com and some are mine own art. I will give credit to them soon.
26/11: Basic game functionality is complete, now I only need a dialouge system.

Build the game with the following command:
`cc main.c player.c -o out -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11`
